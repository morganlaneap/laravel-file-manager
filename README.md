## LaravelFileManager
LaravelFileManager is a simple web file manager written in Laravel with AngularJS.

### Current Features
- Multi-file upload
- All AJAX
- Folder management
- Downloading files

### Updates
I'm working on this in my spare time, so it'll be updated as and when. Feel free to contribute and add things you think would make it awesome.

I have a lot of features planned for the future.

### Installation
1) Clone the repo.
2) Run `composer update`
3) Set your database in `.env` (if it doesn't exist, create a copy from `env.example`)
4) Run `php artisan migrate` to upgrade your database.
5) Navigate to *http://your_host/public/register* and create an account.
6) That's it!
